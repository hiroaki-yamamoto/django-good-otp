## What This?

This script is "Yet Another Implementation" of 2 factor authentication.

## Why I re-invent?

First, I tried [Django OTP], but 2 FA code is required though it should be
optional. Moreover, Admin Panel to edit/fix secret key is not provided.

Then, I tried [django-two-factor-auth], but I found it is the wrapper of
[Django OTP] that requires 2FA code to the user who doesn't have 2FA enabled.

[Django OTP]: https://bitbucket.org/psagers/django-otp
[django-two-factor-auth]: https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth

## How to use

1. Install this script. There's [pip package] and you can install it by
   `pip install django_good_otp`.
2. Create a Django project as usual.
3. Edit settings.py. You will need to edit INSTALLED_APPS and
   AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS. For detail, refer **Edit Settings** section.
4. Run migration as usual.
5. Edit `url.py` of your root URL config to enable QR Code.
   For details, Check out **URL Routing** section.
6. To enable admin panel, you will need to write very small code.
   For details, Check out **Enable Admin Panel** section.
7. To use 2FA on Admin panel login, you will also need to write very simple
   code. For details, Check out **Enable Admin Panel** section.

[pip package]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_good_otp

## Edit settings

You will need to edit configuration such settings.py. The variable to edit
is `INSTALLED_APPS` and `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`.

### INSTALLED_APPS

You will just need to add `'django_otp.DjangoOTP'`
after `'django.contrib.auth'` i.e. it should be like this:

`settings.py`
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    "django_otp.DjangoOTP"
]
```

Note that this depends on the case. i.e. If you have more apps
installed/uninstalled, your `INSTALLED_APPS` list might be longer/shorter than
this.

### AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS

To use 2 FA, you will need to replace authentication backend with the backend
this module provides. i.e. just set `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` in `settings.py`
to `("django_otp.backends.OTPAuthBackend", )`. i.e. like this:

`settings.py`
```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ("django_otp.backends.OTPAuthBackend", )
```

## URL Routing

This module supports QRCode to transfer Secret Key to your device. To
use it, you will need to add `django_otp.urls` with `include` function
like this:

`urls.py`
```python
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^qr/', include("django_otp.urls"))
]
```

## Enable Admin Panel

### Admin Panel

By default, Admin Panel of the model that stores secret key is **disabled**.
To enable Admin Panel, you will need to call `OTPAdmin.enable()` method like
this:

`urls.py`
```python
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin
from django_otp.admin import OTPAdmin

OTPAdmin.enable()

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^qr/', include("django_otp.urls"))
]
```

### Using 2FA form on adminsite

Unfortunately, login template of administration site doesn't handle custom
login form. Therefore, to use 2FA-ready admin form, you will need to replace
`admin.site` with `django_otp.admin.AdminSite`. i.e. like this:

`urls.py`
```python
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin

from django_otp.admin import AdminSite

OTPAdmin.enable()
admin.site = AdminSite()

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^qr/', include("django_otp.urls"))
]
```
